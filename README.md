 This will be the repository for the worker end of our program
 Kindly find the IP address in the code, and change that IP to your own IP,
 I've pretty sure all of yall knows how to get your own IP :)

 Then create a new database named scworker in your phpmyadmin, import the scworker.sql into your database, 
 this will create the neccesary table and columns for your localhost.

Also put the login folder that contains the php files under your xampp/htdocs, 
so that it can run on your localhost
